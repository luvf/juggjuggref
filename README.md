Jugger refering trainnig tools

This is a django project with one main app : juggrefview. this app is mainly a web page :

## Jugg Ref View
 The main goal of this tool is to show and train where you should put your attention as a referee. 
we sart with a game video where you can record your mouse position on it, the mouse should represent where you are looking at as a reff. 
you can choose your position as ref : main, second, goal (for most videos main ref is recommended)
and store your recording to the server.

You can also download other recordings from the server, see what they would have done and also have a score between you and them






## TODOs :
 - User interface : it is functionnal so far, not very practical.
 - User management on the server side : to be able to publish it on the web.
 - Video Management : have a library of games.
 - Better scoring system.
 - Adding other events : player went up too early...
